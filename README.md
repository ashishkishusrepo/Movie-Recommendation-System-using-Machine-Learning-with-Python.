 Movie-Recommendation-System-using-Machine-Learning-with-Python.
 The goal was to build a system that can suggest personalized movie recommendations to users based on their past ratings and preferences.

 Objectives:

To design and implement a movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques
To evaluate the performance of the system using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score
To provide personalized movie recommendations to users based on their past ratings and preferences
To visualize the recommendation results using interactive dashboards and plots
Methodology:

Data preprocessing and feature engineering using Python and the Pandas library
Building and training a collaborative filtering model using the Surprise library
Building and training a content-based filtering model using the TensorFlow library
Hybrid approach combining both collaborative and content-based filtering
Model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning using cross-validation and grid search
Deployment of the recommendation system using a Flask API and a React frontend
Expected Outcomes:

A functional movie recommendation system that provides personalized recommendations to users
Evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score to measure the performance of the system
Interactive visualizations to demonstrate the recommendation results
A scalable and deployable system that can handle large datasets and user traffic
Deliverables:

A written report detailing the methodology, results, and conclusions
A GitHub repository containing the code and documentation for the project
A deployed API and frontend for users to interact with the recommendation system
A presentation summarizing the key findings and results
Skills Used:

Python programming language
Data preprocessing and feature engineering
Collaborative filtering and content-based filtering
Model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning
API development and deployment using Flask
Frontend development using React
Data visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn
